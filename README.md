# PasswordGuessing
This project runs in eclipse, so all file names are relative to the project directory (not the bin). 
To run, type 'java Tester n', where n is the test number. 
The tests are written in the top section of Tester.java, some of which call other functions in the later sections. 
For example, running 'java Tester 7' will call check("password"), which will check to see if the hash of "password" is on any of the lists.
The large lists were run using test 9, keeping the files on an external USB drive.
